# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the Dashboard

## Queue Length:

Description: Total number of URLs waiting to be processed.

Why Important: Indicates if the system is under heavy load or if it's processing URLs at an appropriate pace.

## URLs Processed per Day:

Description: Total number of URLs processed each day.

Why Important: Helps track daily throughput and overall system efficiency.

## Scanning Speed:

Description: Average time taken to scan group of URLs from start to finish.

Why Important: Measures system performance and can signal slowdowns.

## Error Rate:

Description: Percentage of requests that result in errors (e.g., broken links, timeouts).

Why Important: High error rates can indicate issues such as poor network conditions or misconfigurations.

## Worker Efficiency:

Description: Number of active workers and their performance (URLs processed per worker).

Why Important: Helps monitor worker load distribution and detect inefficient workers.

## Average Queue Time per URL:

Description: Average time a URL spends in the queue before being processed.

Why Important: High queue times can indicate a bottleneck in the processing pipeline.

## System Health and Resource Utilization:

Description: Metrics on CPU, memory, and disk usage for the servers running the system.

Why Important: Monitoring resource utilization can help prevent crashes and slowdowns.
